This is the README file for the ad9910 dds synthesizer firmware

The main instance is in the file dds_controller.vhd

The VHDL files can be compiled with the free quartus II web edition which is
available at  http://www.altera.com/

To compile the firmware open the dds_controller.qpf file in quartus II and press ctrl - L
To program the firmware on the FPGA open the Programmer in quartus II and select
active-serial-programming. Add the file dds_controller.pof for programming and press start.


* The control bits in the instruction word are:

opcode :           (31:26)
address:           (25:21)
data available:    (20)
data bus:          (15:0)

The data available bit is used to ensure that all data is settled on the bus.
The opcodes are:

nop:            0x0
dds address:    0x1
fifo write      0x2
dds profile     0x3
dds update      0x4
dds phase       0x8
fifo reset      0x1f

* Writing a register on the dds via the serial port

- Split the data in 16bit words
- Write the data subsequentially into the FIFO with the fifo write insn
- Set the upper 8 bits of the data bus to the desired address
- Provide the dds address Opcode and the address data until the register is set
