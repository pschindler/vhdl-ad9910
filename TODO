Bugs:

- The dds address is the upper byte of the data
- Issues with the read out - or write of the FIFO data
- The profile pin seems to just resemble the 3 lowest bits of bus_in
- The USE_ADDRESSING does not switch off the address_in pins


Features:

- Assign pin numbers
- Add phase registers
- Add IO control for the DDS

Testing:

- Test serial converter and FIFO on hardware
- Test handshake for bus data
