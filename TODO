TODO for AD9910 firmware
========================

Bugs:
-----
- The dds address is the upper byte of the data
- The profile pin seems to just resemble the 3 lowest bits of bus_in
- The USE_ADDRESSING does not switch off the address_in pins
- Is the clk divider for the fifo still necessary?

Features:
---------
- Use process for io_update bit
- Set the pargain pins for phase coherent switching
- Add general clear bit for the phase registers
- Add IO control for the DDS
- Add controls for the DDS ramp functionality

Testing:
--------
- Test phase registers
- Test profiles
- Test analog circuit

Sweeping:
---------

- Add DRCTL and DRHOLD to the dds_profile instruction
