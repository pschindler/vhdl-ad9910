* Bugs:

- The dds address is the upper byte of the data
- The profile pin seems to just resemble the 3 lowest bits of bus_in
- The USE_ADDRESSING does not switch off the address_in pins
- Is the clk divider for the fifo still necessary?

* Features:

- Add general clear bit for the phase registers
- Add IO control for the DDS
- Add controls for the DDS ramp functionality

* Testing:
- Test phase registers
